                <p>
                    The Ministry of Magic is the London-based government headquarters for the British magical community. Accessed through an
                    abandoned red telephone box the Ministry can be reached by dialling 62442 (which spells 'MAGIC' on an alphanumeric
                    keypad). Departments include Magical Law Enforcement and the Department of Mysteries as well as the more pedestrian,
                    Magical Transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ministry of Magic (M.o.M.) was the main governing body of the magical community of Great Britain (i.e. England,
                    Scotland and Wales) and Ireland, with the intention of preservation of magical law. The Ministry connected the British
                    government to the wizarding world. The headquarters of the Ministry was under the HM Treasury building and Whitehall,
                    in central London, deep underground.

            <a id="point2"><h2>Departments</h2></a>
                <p>
                    The Ministry of Magic consists of several departments, each of which is responsible for the song
                    area of magical activity. The departments of the ministry are:
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Department of Mysteries is a highly secret department of the British Ministry of Magic, located in the basement of
                the ministry building. This department contains artifacts of increased magical power and danger: time turners,
                prophecies (in particular, the prophecy about Harry Potter and Voldemort), an entire aquarium of brains, and much more.
                The workers in this department are called ineffables. No one knows either their powers, or the scope of their
                responsibilities... nothing at all. Apparently this department reports directly to the minister. Although, when in the
                middle of the 19th century, the Minister of Magic Radolphus Lestrange decided to disband the Department, the employees
                ignored his decree.</li>
                <li>The Department of Magical Law Enforcement is a department within the Ministry of Magic that is responsible for the
                creation of legal acts regulating the legal side of life in the magical community. The functions of the department also
                include monitoring the implementation of existing legal norms.</li>
                <li>The Department of Magical Games and Sports is a division of the UK Ministry of Magic that organizes
                various sporting events.
                The department was established between 1811 and 1819. Its foundation was due to the strengthening of anti-Muggle
                security measures during magical games. In many ways, the work of the Department overlaps with the work of the Quidditch
                Committee of the International Confederation of Wizards.</li>
